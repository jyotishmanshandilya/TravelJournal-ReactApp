                This is my personal travel journal where i'll be sharing all the destinations 
                I've visited in the past and mark them with a few stats for reference.
                I'll add some dummy pictures for now and later append them with some actual 
                pictures from the trips.
                Hope it turns out as good as I can imagine it to be right now - '30th september, 2022'.
